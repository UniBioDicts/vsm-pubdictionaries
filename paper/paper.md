# Acknowledgements

This work was done during the virtual Europe BioHackathon event that was organized by ELIXIR in November 2020. 
We would like to thank the organizers for the excellent management of such a large scale virtual event with over 200+ participants and for the opportunity to meet, discuss, collaborate and share ideas and technologies with other people, that would be otherwise impossible.
